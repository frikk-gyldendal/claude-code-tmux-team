## The Problem

You have 30 files to refactor. One Claude Code instance. You wait for each file, one by one. It takes forever.

## The Solution

TMUX Claude Team launches **10 Claude Code instances in parallel**, coordinated by a Manager agent that breaks your task into subtasks, dispatches them to idle workers, and monitors progress — all in a single tmux session.

You talk to the Manager. The Manager runs the team. You ship 10x faster.

---

## Quick Start

**Install:**

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/frikk-gyldendal/claude-code-tmux-team/main/web-install.sh | bash
```

Or clone and install locally:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/frikk-gyldendal/claude-code-tmux-team.git
cd claude-code-tmux-team && ./install.sh
```

The installer validates prerequisites automatically (Claude Code CLI, tmux, shell config) and provides clear feedback with colored output.

> **Other platforms:** For Linux server deployment, see [docs/linux-server.md](docs/linux-server.md). For Windows (WSL2), see [docs/windows-wsl2.md](docs/windows-wsl2.md).

**Launch:**

```bash
cd ~/your-project
claude-team            # first time: shows project picker, choose "init"
claude-team            # next time: auto-launches your team
```

That's it. No config files. No shell reload. Just `claude-team`.

---

## What You'll See

When you run `claude-team`, the startup sequence gives you full visibility into what's happening:

1. **ASCII art banner** with your session configuration (grid size, worker count, working directory)
2. **Step-by-step progress** — each phase (grid creation, pane setup, agent launches) shows a checkmark as it completes
3. **Workers boot in ~15 seconds** — Claude Code instances launch in parallel across the grid
4. **Summary dashboard** — a formatted box confirms the session is ready, showing the grid layout and pane assignments

Once the summary appears, switch to the Manager pane (`0.0`) and start giving it tasks.

> Run `claude-team` to see the premium startup experience.

## Commands

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `claude-team` | Smart launch — auto-attach, launch, or show project picker |
| `claude-team init` | Register current directory as a project |
| `claude-team list` | Show all projects with running/stopped status |
| `claude-team stop` | Stop the team for the current project |
| `claude-team update` | Pull latest changes and reinstall |
| `claude-team doctor` | Check installation health and prerequisites |
| `claude-team remove` | Unregister a project by name or current directory |
| `claude-team version` | Show version and installation info |
| `claude-team 4x3` | Launch with a custom grid layout |
| `claude-team --help` | Show all options |

## How It Works

<table>
<tr>
<td width="40" align="center"><strong>0</strong></td>
<td>You register your project: <code>claude-team init</code> (one time per project)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td align="center"><strong>1</strong></td>
<td>You run <code>claude-team</code> — it auto-launches or reattaches to an existing session</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td align="center"><strong>2</strong></td>
<td>You tell the Manager what to do — <em>"Refactor all components to use the new design tokens"</em></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td align="center"><strong>3</strong></td>
<td>The Manager analyzes the task and breaks it into independent, parallelizable subtasks</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td align="center"><strong>4</strong></td>
<td>Each subtask is dispatched to an idle worker with a self-contained prompt</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td align="center"><strong>5</strong></td>
<td>The Watchdog monitors workers and auto-accepts permission prompts to keep them unblocked</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td align="center"><strong>6</strong></td>
<td>The Manager tracks progress and reports back when everything is done</td>
</tr>
</table>

## Features

- **Parallel execution** — 10 workers running simultaneously, not sequentially
- **Smart orchestration** — Manager plans, delegates, and monitors without writing code itself
- **Auto-unblocking** — Watchdog handles `y/n` prompts, permission dialogs, and confirmations
- **Premium startup experience** — ASCII banner, step-by-step progress indicators, and a summary dashboard
- **Session manifest** — Project context written to `/tmp/claude-team/<project>/session.env` so all tools and agents share config
- **Project-aware** — Register projects, auto-attach to running sessions, interactive picker
- **Flexible grid** — Configure `COLSxROWS` to match your screen and workload
- **Message bus** — Workers, Manager, and Watchdog communicate through a lightweight file-based system
- **Slash commands** — Built-in `/tmux-dispatch`, `/tmux-monitor`, `/tmux-team` and more
- **Zero config** — Install, init, launch. Works with any project.
- **Restartable** — Restart workers without killing the Manager with `/tmux-restart-workers`

## Architecture

| Role | Pane | Description |
|------|------|-------------|
| **Manager** | `0.0` | Plans tasks, delegates to workers, monitors progress. Never writes code. |
| **Watchdog** | `0.{cols}` | Monitors all worker panes. Auto-accepts prompts and confirmations. |
| **Workers** | All others | Standard Claude Code instances that do the actual implementation work. |

### Communication

| Channel | Mechanism |
|---------|-----------|
| Task dispatch | `tmux send-keys` / `tmux paste-buffer` |
| Progress monitoring | `tmux capture-pane` |
| Session manifest | `/tmp/claude-team/<project>/session.env` — shared config for all agents |
| Inter-pane messages | `/tmp/claude-team/<project>/messages/` |
| Broadcasts | `/tmp/claude-team/<project>/broadcasts/` |
| Status tracking | `/tmp/claude-team/<project>/status/` |

---

## Configuration

### Session Manifest

Each session creates a manifest at `/tmp/claude-team/<project>/session.env` with session metadata. All agents and slash commands read from this file to stay in sync.

| Variable | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| `PROJECT_DIR` | Absolute path to the project directory |
| `SESSION_NAME` | tmux session name |
| `WORKER_PANES` | Space-separated list of worker pane indices |
| `WATCHDOG_PANE` | Pane index of the Watchdog |
| `GRID` | Grid specification (e.g. `6x2`) |
| `WORKER_COUNT` | Number of worker panes |

### Runtime Directory Structure

All runtime data lives under `/tmp/claude-team/<project>/`:

```
/tmp/claude-team/<project>/
├── session.env        # Session manifest
├── messages/          # Inter-pane messages
├── broadcasts/        # Broadcast messages
├── status/            # Per-pane status files (WORKING/IDLE)
├── research/          # Research task markers
└── reports/           # Research reports
```

### Project Registry

Registered projects are stored in `~/.claude/claude-team/projects` as `name:path` entries (one per line). This file is managed by `claude-team init` and `claude-team remove`.

### Status Hooks

The repo includes `.claude/hooks/status-hook.sh` and `.claude/settings.local.json` which enable automatic WORKING/IDLE status tracking. The hook fires on `UserPromptSubmit` (marks the pane as WORKING) and `Stop` (marks it as IDLE), writing status files to the runtime directory. This powers `/tmux-monitor` and `/tmux-team` real-time worker state display.

To use status hooks in your own project, copy the hook files from the repo:

```bash
cp -r /path/to/claude-code-tmux-team/.claude/hooks/ your-project/.claude/hooks/
cp /path/to/claude-code-tmux-team/.claude/settings.local.json your-project/.claude/settings.local.json
```

---

## Grid Configurations

The grid argument to `claude-team` is a `COLSxROWS` specification. Two panes are always reserved (Manager + Watchdog):

| Grid | Panes | Workers | Best for |
|------|-------|---------|----------|
| `6x2` | 12 | 10 | **Default** — large refactors, codebase sweeps |
| `4x3` | 12 | 10 | Taller panes — better for reading output |
| `4x2` | 8 | 6 | Medium tasks, smaller screens |
| `3x2` | 6 | 4 | Quick parallel tasks |
| `8x1` | 8 | 6 | Single row — maximizes pane height |

## Troubleshooting

<details>
<summary><strong>Workers show "Not logged in"</strong></summary>

Run `claude` manually in a regular terminal to authenticate first. The Watchdog will attempt auto-login but it's not always reliable.

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Terminal too small for grid</strong></summary>

Use a smaller grid like `claude-team 3x2` or maximize your terminal window. The default `6x2` grid needs approximately 200 columns to render properly.

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong><code>claude-team update</code> fails after web install</strong></summary>

The web installer's temporary directory was deleted after install. Fix: clone the repo manually, then run `./install.sh` to update the stored repo path:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/frikk-gyldendal/claude-code-tmux-team.git
cd claude-code-tmux-team && ./install.sh
```

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Workers get stuck</strong></summary>

The Manager can use `/tmux-restart-workers` to kill and restart all workers without restarting itself. This is useful when workers become unresponsive or are in a bad state.

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>macOS notifications not working</strong></summary>

Check System Preferences > Notifications and ensure your terminal app is allowed to send notifications. On Linux, notifications are not supported (the notification system uses macOS-only `osascript`).

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong><code>claude-team</code> command not found</strong></summary>

Add `~/.local/bin` to your PATH by adding this line to your shell config (`~/.zshrc` or `~/.bashrc`):

```bash
export PATH="$HOME/.local/bin:$PATH"
```

Then restart your shell or run `source ~/.zshrc`.

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong><code>claude-team doctor</code> reports issues</strong></summary>

Run `claude-team doctor` and follow the suggestions it provides. It checks tmux, Claude CLI, PATH configuration, agents, commands, and repo path. Most issues can be fixed by re-running `./install.sh`.
